The company receives certain amount of mails everyday from different departments regarding the remarks of various workers given by the supervisers. The user requires the remarks to be converted into grades for them to easily analyse the individual performance of various workers throughout the year. By the end of the year, they must be able to summarise the performance of the workers based on their grades. This requires the developer to extract the excel sheets from the mails everyday and then review only the remarks and then grade them. Finally executing the modified excel back to the mail or storing it in the database.
